              We were commissioned by a Berlin-based creative agency to design a
              collaborative studio environment that could support their growing
              team of graphic designers, video editors, illustrators, and
              content creators. The goal was to strike a balance between open
              creativity and focused productivity â€” a space that fuels
              imagination while staying deeply functional.
            </p>
            <p className="text-[#474646]">
              We delivered a highly adaptive open-plan studio featuring
              custom-built workstations that promote flexibility, inspiration,
              and comfort. Every design choice was made to encourage dynamic
              workflow, spontaneous collaboration, and individual focus when
              needed.

                Each designer received an electric height-adjustable desk with a
                matte white top and oak edging. These were paired with
                anti-fatigue floor mats and personalized color decals based on
                their creative team (video, design, web).

                Desks featured clamp-mounted dual-arm monitor stands with cable
                sleeves, USB hubs, and docking solutions. Workflows involving
                tablets, styluses, and drawing pads were factored into the setup
                with embedded cable routing and easy-access charging ports.

                To soften the energy of a busy creative team, we installed
                vertical acoustic panels in color-gradient fabric between desks.
                These allowed teams to focus without fully isolating, and also
                acted as tackboards for design inspiration and sketches.
